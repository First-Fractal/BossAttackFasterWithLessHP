Boss Attack Faster With Less HP is a mod where the boss's internal attack timer will speed up over time. 
At 100% HP, the attack timer speed would be at 100% speed. And at 0% HP, the attack timer speed would be at 300% speed.
This mod will only affect the vanilla bosses that aren't minibosses or event bosses. 
However, the mod won't affect the Eater of Worlds since he dosn't have differnt moves to switch to.
The mod will also not affect the Lunatic Cultist because it will either make him despawn or 
evenually stuck in his invincible phase.
