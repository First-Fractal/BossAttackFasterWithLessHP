# Boss Attack Faster With Less HP
Boss Attack Faster With Less HP is a mod where the boss's internal attack timer will speed up over time. 
At 100% HP, the attack timer speed would be at 100% speed. And at 0% HP, the attack timer speed would be at 300% speed.
This mod will only affect the vanilla bosses that aren't minibosses or event bosses.
